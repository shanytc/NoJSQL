----- READ ME FOR NO-JSQL -----

NOJSQL Is a library that mimics mySql db commands on a local JSON db representation.
the NOJSQL Engine v1.0 Supports this <Commands>:

- SELECT <field(s)> FROM <table> ORDER BY <field(s)>

<Missing Commands>
WHERE clause is missing
INNER JOIN clause is missing.
LIMIT <X>; is missing.
Functions are missing.
and more...

Hopefully this library will help people when they need noSql support with mySql implementation on their sites.
