# READ ME FOR NoJSQL

NOJSQL Is a library that mimics mySql commands on a local JSON mySQL DB representation.
the NOJSQL Engine v1.0 Supports currently these statements:

## SELECT <field(s)> FROM <table> ORDER BY <field(s)> LIMIT <x>;

###Missing Commands:

WHERE clause is missing
INNER JOIN clause is missing.
Functions are missing.
and more...

Hopefully this library will help people when they need noSql support with mySql implementation on their sites.
